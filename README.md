# stock-market-application
Simulation of stock market trading

This stock market application allows the user to view the current price of one or more stocks, buy and sell stocks, and to view their current portfolio. Every time the user checks the price of a stock, the price will change based on a multiplier. The portfolio is saved when the user buys or sells a stock. The program reads from the tickers and prices from the file mystocks.txt.
